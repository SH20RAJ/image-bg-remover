- 🧼 Clean, intuitive interface
- 🔍 Side-by-side image comparison

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd background-remover
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/MacOS
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Start the application:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. The application will start and open in your default web browser
   - 🌐 Local URL (usually http://localhost:8501)
   - 📡 Network URL (for local network access)

3. Use the application:
   - 📂 Upload an image using the sidebar upload button
   - 🖼️ The original and processed images will be displayed
   - 💾 Download the processed image using the sidebar download button

## 🔍 Technical Details

The background removal process uses the following steps:
1. Converts the image to grayscale
2. Applies binary thresholding to create a mask
3. Uses the mask to extract the foreground

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- streamlit
- opencv-python
- numpy
- Pillow

## 🛠️ Development

To modify the background removal algorithm, edit the `remove_background()` function in `main.py`. The current implementation uses a simple threshold-based approach, but you could implement more sophisticated methods like:
- Grab Cut
- Deep learning-based segmentation
- Color-based segmentation
